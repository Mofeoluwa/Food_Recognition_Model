Introduction
The Food Recognition Model is a machine learning project that can recognize different types of food images using deep learning techniques. It is trained on a large dataset of food images and is capable of identifying various food categories such as pizza, sushi, hamburger, etc.

The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze the images and classify them into different categories. The model is designed to be accurate and fast, so it can be used in real-time applications such as restaurant menu scanning, food ordering apps, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used to train the Food Recognition Model is a collection of images of different types of food. It consists of over 100,000 images of food items, which are categorized into various food types. The dataset was obtained from kaggle and personal collections.

Installation and Dependencies
To use the Food Recognition Model, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
TensorFlow 2
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
